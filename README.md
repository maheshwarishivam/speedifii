    - System Libraries: These are always included
        + Redis Sessions: Store PHP Sessions in Redis Server (Only loaded if required)
        + UUID: Generate or Validate a v3, v4 or v5 UUID.
    - User Libraries: These are included on a per need basis. They can also be `autoloaded`.
        + cURL Library: It allows you to make cURL requests to any RESTful web service. It automatically parses data to be sent in `form-data`, `x-www-form-urlencoded` and `JSON`. Obviously supports sending `raw` data. Dis I mention that response received in `JSON` is also automatically parsed!
