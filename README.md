# SpeediFii PHP Framework

Speedifii PHP Framework was created to reduce the time to market for modern day applications.

Features:

1. MMVC: Implements the Modular Model View Controller Design Pattern
2. Application Logs [**Which are written to disk AFTER the response is sent to the client**]
3. Support for Plug an Play Libraries. Just create a `libraryname.autoload.inc` and you are done!
4. Multilingual: Multi Lingual Support
5. Official Libraries:
    - System Libraries: These are always included
        + Redis Sessions: Store PHP Sessions in Redis Server (Only loaded if required)
        + UUID: Generate or Validate a v3, v4 or v5 UUID.
        + Logger Library: Write Application logs to disk. More instances of logger can be initialized and used if required.
    - User Libraries: These are included on a per need basis. They can also be `autoloaded`.
        + MySQL Library: It allows you to interact with MySQL and do basic CRUD easily. You can obviously run complex custom queries.
        + cURL Library: It allows you to make cURL requests to any RESTful web service. It automatically parses data to be sent in `form-data`, `x-www-form-urlencoded` and `JSON`. Obviously supports sending `raw` data. Did I mention that response received in `JSON` is also automatically parsed!
